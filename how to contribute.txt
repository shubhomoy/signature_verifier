Basic Process
1. Create a new feature branch.
2. Add and push multiple commits in that branch.
3. Use git rebase to squash/organize commits if needed.
4. Create a PR against the develop branch.
5. Request a code review.
6. The reviewer merges the PR into develop when satisfied.
7. The reviewer deletes the feature branch.

Code Review Best Practices
1. Do not make it personal and do not take it personally. The review is of the code, not the author.
2. Ask questions. Do not make demands.
3. Ask for clarification and be willing to give explanations.
4. Comments should be made using Github. A Pull request is a valuable form of documentation.
5. Accept that many programming decisions are choices, that there is not always a single correct choice, and that code can always be refactored later.
6. Code reviewers should clearly communicate if they feel a change is required or simply a suggestion.

Issues
1. Any one can create an issue if they feel they need to add a feature or report a bug or do some enhancement.
2. Make sure to add appropriate label to it.
3. Any one can take up an issue and assign to themselves and create PRs
